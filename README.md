# Minecraft
"Recreation" of Minecraft in C++ using OpenGL in one week.

Completed as a learning experience to strengthen skills in C++ and the basics of OpenGL while I was recovering from surgery.

- [x] Implemented a chunk based loading system with optimizations to cull hidden faces.
- [x] Added simple animations using seperate models for each frame.
- [x] Allowed breaking of blocks with ray casting.
- [ ] World generation
- [ ] Enemies
- [ ] Crafting

Due to my lack of experience with programming animations and ray casting, it took a while to get them working. By the time they had been implemented, there was not enough time left for the rest.
